# JogoDaVelha

Create a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

We should have a RESTART button that restarts the game

There’s two players (“X” and “O”) that takes turns during the game

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner, we should display the winner somehow. example:

[X][O][O]

[O][X][X]

[O][   ][X]

 X is the winner!
